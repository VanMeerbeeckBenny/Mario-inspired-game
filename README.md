# Mario Look-Alike Game

## Legal Considerations

As this project was created in school where legal issues were not a concern, I used many original assets. Due to copyright laws, all assets have been removed. Consequently, the game cannot be run, but you can explore the code.

## Project

A Mario-like game created in Python with Pygame.

- **Swinging Mechanic:** Players can swing with a rope on certain blocks.
- **Auto-save Feature:** Auto-save points are strategically placed in levels for convenience.
- **Power-ups and Shooting:** Power-ups include growing larger and shooting abilities.
- **Varied Enemies:** Enemies include turtles and red mushrooms.
- **Unique Projectile:** Mario shoots cannon bullets instead of the standard fireball, these move linearly instead of bouncing. Bullets are displayed in the interface in the bottom right corner.
- **Bullet Management:** Players have a limited supply of five bullets, which regenerate slowly. Taking a flower when able to shoot refills the bullets.
- **Start Screen:** The game features a start screen with a standard background and an idle animation character.
- **Physics Integration:** The game integrates physics for actions such as jumping and shooting.


## Motivation

My internship involves working with Python, motivating me to explore this language further. Creating a game was driven by my desire to delve into game development as this is fun and challenging.
